// Create a function which answers the question "Are you playing banjo?".
// If your name starts with the letter "R" or lower case "r", you are playing banjo!

// The function takes a name as its only argument, and returns one of the following strings:

// name + " plays banjo" 
// name + " does not play banjo"
// Names given are always valid strings.


function areYouPlayingBanjo(name) {
    // Implement me
    if(name[0].toUpperCase() == 'R'){
      return `${name} plays banjo`
    }
    return `${name} does not play banjo`;
}
